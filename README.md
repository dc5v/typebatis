Combined TypeScript with MyBatis, and the result is... drumroll... 

`Typebatis!`

---

Hey there!  

This project is an experimental attempt to use MyBatis within TypeScript. 

You know how ORM can sometimes get annoying when you're dealing with complex SQL queries? 

So I decided to create Typebatis and see how it performs in real projects. 

Wish me luck! ðŸ˜„
